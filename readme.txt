Creates a new widget to easily add mailing lists integration to a Genesis website. Works with FeedBurner, MailChimp, AWeber, FeedBlitz, ConvertKit and more.

== Description ==

Creates a new widget to easily add mailing lists to a Genesis website. Recommended plugin in virtually all Genesis theme tutorials. The widget allows the site administrator to set either the Feedburner ID or form action, e-mail form field and hidden fields to mimic the subscribe form of other mailing list services.

== Installation ==

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In Appearance->Widgets, add Genesis eNews Extended widget to any sidebar.
1. Using the mailing list contact form code provided by your vendor, add the form action URL, the form field ID for the e-mail field and any hidden fields (not all services use them) into the widget options. See some tips for this on the [plugin's install page](https://kraft.blog/genesis-enews-extended/install).
1. If using name fields, read the [plugin's tutorial website](https://kraft.blog/genesis-enews-extended/tutorials).
1. Verify it works!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What services work with this plugin? =

Feedburner, MailChimp, Aweber, FeedBlitz, ConvertKit, and Constant Contact are confirmed to work, but it should work with almost all services. If you have tested this with other services, please [contact me](https://kraft.blog/contact/)

= How do I get the privacy policy link to show? The checkbox isn't working. =

Genesis eNews Extended uses WordPress' built-in privacy policy setting. Be sure you have a privacy page set at wp-admin/privacy.php .

= The "Opens in Same Tab" option doesn't work with FeedBurner. What's wrong? =

That is intentional. You don't want to knock people off your site and leave them on FeedBurner's.

= The first and last name fields look funky. =

= I need help! Where I can get it? =

"Official" tutorials will be maintained on the [plugin's website](https://kraft.blog/genesis-enews-extended/).
